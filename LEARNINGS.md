Description: It's like Tinder but for restaurants! The project asks a user for location first. Using this information, we get a list of restaurants that best match the user using Yelp's API. The application will then suggest a restaurant to the user. The user can then "swipe" to the right to accept the restaurant. Then using Google Maps Javascript API and Google Maps Direction API, the application will output directions to get to the user's choice from the location they inputed. The user can also choose a previous restaurant if they preferred a previous choice instead of their current.

These are the following web technologies used throughout this project: 

1. Javascript: It's responsibile for the static serving of our webpage. The Javascript also does validation on the form we have on the contact page, and updates the displayed data. 
2. CSS: CSS is responsible for how everything looks on the webpage, from the color, font's used, and where each of the portions are positioned on the webpage. 
3. HTML: HTML provides that actual content on the page (including the structure and contents of a website).
4. NodeJS/Npm libraries: They allow for there to be server-side javascript manipulations, so that HTTP requests can be received/responded to.
5. Yelp API: Used to access Yelp's restaurant data. 
6. Google Maps Javascript API: Used to integrate google maps data. 
7. Google Maps Directions API: Used to properly output directions based on locations inputted.
8. Jquery -- ajax: Used on client-side to communicate with our server without page refreshing. 
9. JSON: Used to format data properly for the sake of data interchanging. 
10. HTTP: Translates/transmits/formats our messages sent out on the web.
11. TCP: Allows for reliable, correct and ordered data in a manner that allows us to post/get data without the data being lost, corrupted or congested. 
12. IP: Allows for the communication of our API, server and our client. 
13. Heroku: Used to build our application and launch it on a URL provided to us.
